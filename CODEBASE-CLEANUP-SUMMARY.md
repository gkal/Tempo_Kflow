# Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup work done to improve code maintainability, reduce redundancy, and prepare for future codebase improvements. The changes were made without altering UI functionality, as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Component Utilities

Created `src/utils/componentUtils.ts` with utility functions to help manage component deprecation:

- `logDeprecationWarning`: Standardized warning logging for deprecated components
- `withDeprecationWarning`: HOC to wrap deprecated components with warnings

These utilities allow components to be marked for deprecation while maintaining backward compatibility.

### 2. Updated Deprecated Components

The following components were identified as deprecated and updated to log proper warnings:

- **Tooltip Components**:
  - `tooltip.tsx` - Marked as deprecated, now forwards to `GlobalTooltip.tsx`
  - `truncated-text.tsx` - Marked as deprecated, now forwards to `TruncateWithTooltip` in `GlobalTooltip.tsx`

- **Tabs Components**:
  - `tabs.tsx` - Marked as deprecated, now logs warnings about using `app-tabs.tsx`
  - `custom-tabs.tsx` - Marked as deprecated, now logs warnings about using components in `app-tabs.tsx`

### 3. Preserved Key UI Components

Particular care was taken to preserve the tooltip implementation used in the ServiceTypesPage:

- The `TruncateWithTooltip` component from `GlobalTooltip.tsx` is preserved as-is
- This component is the recommended replacement for the deprecated tooltip components
- All functionality, styling, and behavior of this component remains unchanged
- The migration path ensures identical UI appearance and behavior

### 4. Created Migration Documentation

Added detailed migration guides:

- `src/components/ui/DEPRECATED-COMPONENTS.md` - Complete migration guide for deprecated components
- Inline documentation in deprecated components explaining migration paths
- Specific examples showing how to migrate while preserving UI functionality

### 5. Added Unused Code Detection

- Created a comprehensive script to identify potentially unused exports in the codebase
- Enhanced with confidence scoring to prioritize likely candidates for removal
- Added specialized npm scripts for scanning specific directories:
  - `npm run find-unused:utils` - Scan utility functions
  - `npm run find-unused:services` - Scan service files
  - `npm run find-unused:business` - Scan business components while excluding UI components
- Implemented smart detection that considers dynamic imports, index files, and common patterns
- The script can be run with `npm run find-unused` for basic usage
- Advanced options available for customization
- Thoroughly documented usage in `FUTURE-CLEANUP-TASKS.md`

### 6. Consolidated Dialog Helpers

Created improved dialog management utilities:

- `src/hooks/useDialogHelpers.ts` - Provides functions for showing confirm and alert dialogs
- `src/hooks/useDialogCleanup.ts` - Handles automatic cleanup of dialogs when components unmount
- Added support for callback functions (onConfirm, onCancel, onOk, onClose)
- Implemented better dialog ID management with the `createDialogId` utility

### 7. Migrated Form Helpers

Consolidated and improved form helper utilities:

- Migrated `src/lib/form-helpers.ts` to `src/utils/formHelpers.ts`
- Updated all imports across the codebase to use the new location
- Removed the deprecated file after verifying all references were updated

### 8. Updated Utility Exports

- Updated `src/utils/index.ts` to include the new component utilities module
- Created `src/hooks/index.ts` for cleaner imports of hook functions
- Ensured proper naming to avoid collisions

## Migration Strategy

Rather than immediately deleting deprecated components, we've implemented a staged approach:

1. **Current Phase**: Components are maintained for backward compatibility but log deprecation warnings
2. **Future Phase**: Once all usages are migrated, the deprecated components can be safely removed

This approach ensures existing functionality isn't broken while encouraging migration to new components.

## Future Work

1. **Complete Migration**: 
   - Help teams migrate from old components to new consolidated ones
   - Run the unused code detection script to identify other candidates for cleanup

2. **Code Removal**:
   - After migration is complete, safely remove the deprecated components
   - Remove any other unused code identified by the script (after manual verification)

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Keep documentation updated as components evolve
   - Ensure examples remain current

See the `FUTURE-CLEANUP-TASKS.md` document for a detailed roadmap of additional cleanup tasks.

## Important Notes

- **No UI Changes**: All changes were made while preserving UI functionality
- **Special Component Preservation**: The tooltip style used in ServiceTypesPage has been explicitly preserved
- **Deprecation Warnings**: Console warnings will appear when deprecated components are used
- **Manual Verification**: Always manually verify before removing code identified by automated tools
