**Started**: 01-04-2025
**Status**: In Progress

#### Objective
Perform a comprehensive audit of all delete operations in the project to ensure we exclusively use soft delete.

#### Tasks
1. [ ] Audit all service files for delete operations
   - [ ] Review supabaseService.ts delete functions
   - [ ] Check all service files that import deleteRecord
   - [ ] Verify soft delete implementation in each service
   - [ ] Document any instances of hard delete usage

2. [ ] Review component delete operations
   - [ ] Search for direct deleteRecord calls
   - [ ] Check for any direct Supabase delete operations
   - [ ] Verify all components use service layer for deletions

3. [ ] Database schema verification
   - [ ] Confirm all tables have is_deleted and deleted_at columns
   - [ ] Verify indexes on these columns
   - [ ] Check existing triggers/policies related to deletion

4. [ ] Query analysis
   - [ ] Review all SELECT queries to ensure they filter out soft-deleted records
   - [ ] Check JOIN operations for proper handling of soft-deleted records
   - [ ] Verify any reporting queries handle soft deletes correctly

5. [ ] Documentation
   - [ ] Document any cases requiring hard delete with justification
   - [ ] Get team review and approval for any hard delete cases
   - [ ] Update technical documentation with soft delete requirements
