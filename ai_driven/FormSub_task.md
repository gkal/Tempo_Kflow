# Form Link Implementation Tasks - DETAILED BREAKDOWN
**PROJECT STATUS: COMPLETED** - All tasks have been successfully implemented and tested.

## Overall Architecture
The form link system follows these architecture principles:
- **Soft Delete Pattern**: All database operations use the `softDeleteRecord` function from supabaseService
- **Central Data Management**: All database interactions use the central functions:
  - `createRecord<T>` for creating records
  - `updateRecord<T>` for updating records
  - `softDeleteRecord<T>` for safe deletion
  - `fetchRecords<T>` for retrieving records with filtering
  - `fetchRecordById<T>` for getting single records
- **Customer-First Approach**: 
  - Form links are generated directly from customer records
  - NO offers are created until the form is submitted by the customer
  - Form links are associated with customer records, not offers
- **User Approval Workflow**:
  - Customer form submissions require approval by any system user (except readonly users)
  - Multiple approval methods (UI, email, mobile) for 24/7 operation
  - Form data securely stored until approved
  - Complete audit trail of approval actions
- **Component Standards**:
  - Delete operations use `ModernDeleteConfirmation` component
  - Tables use `VirtualTable` with virtual scrolling
  - Responsive design with Tailwind
  - Consistent styling patterns
