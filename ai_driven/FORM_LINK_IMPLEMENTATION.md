# Customer Form Link System Implementation Guide

## üéØ Project Overview
This document outlines the implementation steps for creating a secure offer form link system that allows:
- Generating unique form links for specific offers
- Sending these links via Gmail integration (same button creates link and opens Gmail)
- Collecting form submissions from customers related to specific offers
- Storing the data directly in the existing offer records
- Sending complete submission data via email notification
- Implementing proper security measures and expiration

## üìã Phase 1: Database Setup

1. **Create Offer Form Links Table**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE offer_form_links (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
     offer_id UUID REFERENCES offers(id) NOT NULL,
     token TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
     is_used BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
     expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
     is_deleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
     deleted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
   );
   ```

## üì¶ Phase 2: Backend Implementation

1. **Create FormLinkService (src/services/formLinkService.ts)**
   - Implement functions for:
     - `generateFormLink(offerId: string, expirationHours: number)`
     - `validateFormLink(token: string)`
     - `markFormLinkAsUsed(token: string)`
     - `getFormLinksByOfferId(offerId: string)`

2. **Create OfferFormService (src/services/offerFormService.ts)**
   - Implement functions for:
     - `updateOfferFromFormSubmission(offerId: string, formData: any)`
     - `getOfferDataForForm(offerId: string)`
     - `getCustomerInfoForOffer(offerId: string)` - To get customer email for sending link

3. **Create Email Service with Resend (src/services/emailService.ts)**
   - Set up Resend client with API key
   - Implement functions for:
     - `sendFormLinkToCustomer(customerEmail: string, customerName: string, offerDetails: any, formLink: string)`
     - `sendFormSubmissionNotification(offerData: Offer, formData: any, previousData: any)`
   - Create detailed email template for form submissions that includes:
     - Complete form submission data (all fields)
     - Highlighting of new/changed values
     - Offer and customer information
     - Timestamp and link to view in system

4. **Create Gmail Integration Service (src/services/gmailService.ts)**
   - Implement function to generate Gmail compose URL:
     - `generateGmailComposeUrl(to: string, subject: string, body: string)`
   - Include the form link in the email body
   - Pre-populate customer email from offer/customer relationship

5. **Create API Routes**
   - `pages/api/forms/create-link.ts` - Generate link and return Gmail URL
   - `pages/api/forms/validate/[token].ts` - Validate token and return form configuration
   - `pages/api/forms/submit/[token].ts` - Submit form data and send email notification

## üñºÔ∏è Phase 3: Frontend Implementation

1. **Create Offer Form Link Button with Integrated Gmail**
   - Add "Create Form Link" button to offer details page that:
     - Generates unique link for the specific offer
     - Immediately opens Gmail compose window with:
       - Pre-populated recipient (customer email from offer)
       - Pre-filled subject line with offer reference
       - Form link included in email body
     - Stores the link in database
     - Single click performs both actions (create link + open Gmail)

2. **Create Form Page Components**
   - `pages/form/[token].tsx` - Main form page that handles:
     - Token validation
     - Expiration checking
     - Form rendering with offer-specific information
     - Submission handling
     - Success/Error states

3. **Create Mobile-Optimized Form Components**
   - `src/components/forms/OfferForm.tsx` - The mobile-friendly form to be filled by customers
     - Use responsive Tailwind classes
     - Implement touch-friendly form controls
     - Ensure proper spacing for mobile inputs
     - Optimize for various screen sizes
     - Include offer-specific fields and information
   - `src/components/forms/FormExpired.tsx` - Component shown when form is expired
   - `src/components/forms/FormSuccess.tsx` - Success page after submission
   - `src/components/forms/FormError.tsx` - Error handling component

4. **Create Form Context (src/context/FormContext.tsx)**
   - State management for form
   - Validation logic
   - Form submission handling

## üîí Phase 4: Security Implementation

1. **Token Generation and Validation**
   - Use cryptographically secure UUIDs
   - Implement proper token validation logic
   - Add rate limiting to prevent abuse

2. **API Route Protection**
   - Implement rate limiting middleware
   - Add request validation
   - Set up proper CORS configuration

3. **Email Security with Resend**
   - Store Resend API key in environment variables
   - Implement proper email templates with branding
   - Ensure emails include privacy policy links
   - Set up proper email authentication (SPF, DKIM)

4. **Input Sanitization**
   - Implement server-side validation for all form inputs
   - Sanitize inputs before storing in database
   - Set up prepared statements for all database operations
