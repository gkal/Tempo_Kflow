# Chat Log: Phone Matching Enhancement for Deleted Records

## Session Details
- **Start Time:** April 3, 2025, 19:00
- **End Time:** April 3, 2025, 19:15
- **Topic:** Implementing deleted records visibility in phone-only matching

## Summary
Enhanced the duplicate detection system to properly include and visually highlight deleted records in both regular and phone-only match results. This was done by removing filters that excluded deleted records from query results and improving UI styling to make deleted records more prominent.

## Modified Files
1. `src/services/duplicateDetectionService.ts` - Updated search functions to include deleted records
2. `src/components/customers/CustomerForm.tsx` - Enhanced UI for better visualization of deleted records

## User Requests and Implemented Solutions

### Problem
The phone-only search feature was not finding deleted records with matching phone numbers, limiting the system's ability to detect potential duplicates across all records.

### Solution
1. **Backend Changes:**
   - Removed `.is('deleted_at', null)` filter from both `findDuplicatesByPhoneOnly` and `findPotentialDuplicates` functions
   - Updated database queries to select the `deleted_at` column
   - Fixed type handling for database records by using a more flexible type approach

2. **UI Enhancements:**
   - Added a strikethrough style to company names of deleted records
   - Implemented a prominent "ΔΙΑΓΡΑΜΜΕΝΟΣ" (DELETED) badge with an archive icon
   - Applied a darker background with red tint to deleted record rows
   - Ensured consistent styling between regular and phone-only match sections

### Key Benefits
- Complete visibility of all matching records regardless of deletion status
- Clear visual differentiation between active and deleted records
- Consistent user experience across all match types
- Improved data quality by preventing the creation of duplicates of deleted records
