# Chat Log: Fuzzball.js Implementation for Customer Duplicate Detection

## 📅 Session Information
- **Start Time:** April 2, 2025, 2:00 PM
- **End Time:** April 2, 2025, 6:30 PM

## 📝 Summary
Successfully implemented the fuzzball.js library for fuzzy string matching in the customer duplicate detection feature. Replaced the placeholder implementation with the actual fuzzy matching algorithm, modified the service to use token_sort_ratio for company name matching, and updated the UI component to display match details. Enhanced the early detection feature to start searching after 3 characters and display color-coded matches. Fixed a database schema issue where the 'is_deleted' column was named 'deleted' in the database. Extended the search to include deleted customers with appropriate visual indicators.

## 🔧 Technical Decisions
1. **Chose fuzzball.js over RapidFuzz-js** because:
   - RapidFuzz-js was not available as an npm package
   - Fuzzball.js is a popular JavaScript port of TheFuzz (formerly FuzzyWuzzy) Python library
   - Offers token_sort_ratio algorithm for handling word order differences in company names
   - Has TypeScript support with built-in type declarations
   - Actively maintained with 570+ GitHub stars and 95,000+ weekly downloads

2. **Implemented weighted scoring system** with:
   - Company name: 30% using token_sort_ratio for fuzzy matching
   - Phone number: 20% using standardized digit-only comparison
   - AFM (tax ID): 50% using exact matching

3. **Enhanced user experience** by:
   - Adding match details to show which fields contributed to the match
   - Implementing real-time feedback as users type
   - Providing one-click navigation to existing records
   - Using debouncing to prevent excessive API calls
   - Adding color-coded match display (yellow for 75-80%, red for >80%)
   - Automatically expanding match details for high-confidence matches
   - Adding visual indicators for deleted customers

4. **Fixed database schema inconsistency**:
   - Discovered that the customers table uses 'deleted' column instead of 'is_deleted'
   - Updated the Supabase query to use the correct column name
   - Documented the difference for future reference

5. **Enhanced search capabilities**:
   - Extended search to include both active and deleted customers
   - Implemented graceful fallback for different database schemas:
     - First tries with 'deleted' column
     - Falls back to 'is_deleted' column if 'deleted' doesn't exist
     - As a last resort, searches without any soft delete filter
   - Added Archive icon and "Διαγραμμένος" (Deleted) badge for deleted customers

## 🛠️ Modified Files
1. **src/services/duplicateDetectionService.ts**
   - Imported fuzzball library and implemented token_sort_ratio for name matching
   - Replaced placeholder implementation with actual fuzzy matching
   - Maintained the weighted scoring system (30% name, 20% phone, 50% AFM)
   - Enhanced to fetch additional customer fields (doy, email, address, town, postal_code)
   - Set minimum threshold to 75% for early detection
   - Fixed Supabase query to use 'deleted' column instead of 'is_deleted'
   - Added support for searching deleted customers
   - Implemented schema-adaptive query strategy for different database configurations
   
2. **src/components/customers/DuplicateDetection.tsx**
   - Updated to use actual findPotentialDuplicates service
   - Removed mock data implementation
   - Added getMatchDetails function to display which fields contributed to the match
   - Enhanced UI to show more detailed match information
   - Added color-coded display based on match confidence
   - Implemented early detection after 3 characters in company name
   - Auto-expanded matches for high-confidence duplicate alerts
   - Added visual badge with Archive icon for deleted customers
   
3. **ai_driven/TASK.md**
   - Updated tasks to mark all duplicate detection items as completed
   - Documented implementation details and future enhancements
   - Added note about database schema differences
   - Added details about searching deleted customers

## 🔍 User Requests
1. Implement RapidFuzz for better fuzzy matching
2. Replace the placeholder implementation with actual fuzzy matching
3. Update the duplicate detection service and component
4. Add early detection starting with 3 characters in company name
5. Use color-coded matches (yellow for 75-80%, red for >80%)
6. Show more detailed customer information in matches
7. Fix database column error in the Supabase query
8. Add the ability to scan deleted customers for potential duplicates

## 🎯 Proposed Solutions
1. **Used fuzzball.js as a substitute** for RapidFuzz since it provides equivalent functionality
2. **Implemented token_sort_ratio** for company name matching which handles different word orders
3. **Enhanced the UI** to show more detailed match information
4. **Maintained the weighted scoring system** as originally planned
5. **Added color-coded matching** for better visual differentiation
6. **Implemented early detection** to start after 3 characters in company name
7. **Expanded customer details** to show complete information
8. **Fixed database schema mismatch** by using 'deleted' column instead of 'is_deleted'
9. **Expanded search to include deleted customers** with visual indicators
10. **Implemented adaptive database query** to handle different schema configurations

## 📋 TO DO Items
1. Consider adding contact information to the matching algorithm
2. Explore address fuzzy matching for enhanced detection
3. Create a merge functionality for true duplicates
4. Generate monthly duplicate detection reports to monitor system effectiveness
5. Address TypeScript linter warning in the duplicateDetectionService (low priority)
6. Audit and update other services that may be using 'is_deleted' instead of 'deleted'
