## 📋 Summary
In this session, we improved the phone search functionality in the CustomerForm component by:
1. Fixing issues with the existing implementation that was using `normalize_phone` function
2. Implementing a more reliable search approach that combines SQL ILIKE queries with JavaScript filtering
3. Adding proper logging to track the search process and results
4. Ensuring the phone search works efficiently for partial number searches

## 📂 Modified Files

## 💬 User Requests and Solutions

### Request: Fix phone search functionality
The user needed to improve the phone search in their CustomerForm component, especially in cases where partial phone numbers are entered without other customer information.

### Solution:
1. First attempted to implement a raw SQL query approach using the `normalize_phone` database function, but encountered issues with the RPC calls
2. Then moved to a hybrid approach using direct Supabase queries with ILIKE combined with JavaScript-side filtering to normalize phone numbers
3. Added detailed logging to track the search process and result filtering
4. Ensured phone numbers are properly normalized by stripping non-digit characters for comparison

## ✅ Key Implementation Notes
- The search now uses `ILIKE` with wildcards to find phone numbers containing the specified digits
- JavaScript post-processing mimics the behavior of the database's `normalize_phone` function
- Result records are scored and formatted with match reasons to highlight matches
- The approach is more reliable because it doesn't depend on calling SQL functions directly

## 📌 TO DO
- Consider adding a normalized phone column to the database for better indexing and search performance
- Evaluate performance on large datasets
- Add unit tests to verify phone search behavior with various input formats
