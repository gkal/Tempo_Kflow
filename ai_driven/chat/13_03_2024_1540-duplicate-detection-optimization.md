# Chat Log: Duplicate Detection Optimization
Date: 13/03/2024
Time: 15:40

## Summary
Discussion focused on optimizing the duplicate customer detection functionality in the application. The main goal was to improve response time while maintaining the existing functionality.

## Key Points Discussed
1. Current Implementation Analysis:
   - Uses 500ms debounce before searching
   - Loads all customers from database
   - Performs fuzzy matching on company names
   - Has working scoring system for matches
   - Handles AFM and telephone matching

2. Performance Bottleneck Identified:
   - 500ms delay before search starts is too high
   - Database has only 82 total records (55 active)
   - Current implementation works perfectly, just needs faster response

3. Solution Agreed:
   - Keep ALL existing functionality exactly as is
   - Only change: Reduce debounce time from 500ms to 100ms
   - This will make the system feel more responsive while maintaining all current logic

## Files to Modify
1. `CustomerForm.tsx`:
   - Change debounce timeout from 500ms to 100ms
   - No other changes needed

## Implementation Plan
1. Make single focused change:
```typescript
// In CustomerForm.tsx
const debounceTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
  detectDuplicates();
}, 100);  // Changed from 500ms to 100ms
```

## Important Notes
- Do NOT change any existing functionality
- Keep all fuzzy matching logic
- Keep all scoring systems
- Keep all display logic
- Only change the debounce timing

## Next Steps
1. Implement the debounce timing change
2. Test to ensure all existing functionality works exactly as before
3. Verify improved response time

## Status
- [ ] Implementation pending
- [ ] Testing pending
- [ ] Verification pending
