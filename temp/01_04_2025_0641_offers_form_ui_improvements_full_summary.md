## Overview
Improved the UI/UX of the offers form by making several adjustments to textareas, dropdowns, and overall layout.

## Modified Files
1. `src/components/offers/main_offers_form/offer-dialog/BasicTab.tsx`:
   - Adjusted textarea heights to show 3 lines using Tailwind classes
   - Added consistent left padding (pl-2) to all dropdown components
   - Abbreviated dropdown header labels for better space usage
   - Organized dropdowns in a 3-column grid layout
   - Removed unnecessary CSS classes in favor of Tailwind

2. `src/components/offers/main_offers_form/offer-dialog/OffersDialog.css`:

   - Migrated styles to Tailwind classes

## Key Changes

### Textarea Improvements
- Set textarea height to show 3 lines using `h-[6rem]`
- Added consistent padding and line height
- Made textareas non-resizable
- Maintained proper border and focus styles

### Dropdown Enhancements
- Added consistent left padding (`pl-2`) to all GlobalDropdown components
- Reduced header widths to `w-12` for better space utilization
- Abbreviated header labels:
  - "Κατάσταση" → "Κατ."
  - "Αποτέλεσμα" → "Αποτ."

### Layout Changes
- Organized dropdowns in a 3-column grid for better alignment
- Maintained consistent spacing and padding throughout
- Removed "Νέα Προσφορά" text from dialog title

## Design Decisions
1. Used Tailwind CSS exclusively for styling to maintain consistency
2. Kept the UI clean and efficient with abbreviated labels
3. Ensured proper padding and spacing for better readability
4. Maintained accessibility and usability standards

## TO DO
1. Verify that textareas consistently display 3 lines across different screen sizes
2. Test dropdown behavior with longer text content
3. Consider adding tooltips for abbreviated labels if needed
4. Review and test form submission with the new layout

## Notes
