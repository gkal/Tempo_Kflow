# Final Examples and Test Files Backup

This directory contains example and test files that were removed from the codebase as part of the final cleanup process. These files aren't being used in the main application flow.

## Categories of Removed Files

1. **Example Components**
   - SimpleLiveDataView.tsx - An example component demonstrating live data functionality

2. **Test Components**
   - TestTable.tsx - A test table component that isn't used in production code
   - TanStackTable.tsx - Another test component for TanStack Table that isn't used in production

## Restoration

If any of these files are needed in the future, they can be restored from this backup directory. The files maintain their original directory structure for easy restoration.

## Notes

After analyzing the codebase and imports, we determined that:

1. None of these example and test components are imported anywhere in the application
2. They appear to be developmental/educational components that aren't used in production
3. The App.tsx file has references to these components in lazy imports, but they aren't actually used in the rendered routes

Removing these files completes the cleanup process and should not affect the application's functionality.
