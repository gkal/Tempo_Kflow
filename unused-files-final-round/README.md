# Final Round of Unused Files Backup

This directory contains the final set of unused files that were removed from the codebase to fix remaining TypeScript errors. These files aren't being used in the main application flow.

## Categories of Removed Files

1. **UI Components**
   - charts.tsx - A charts component that isn't used anywhere
   - breadcrumb.tsx - A breadcrumb component that isn't used anywhere

2. **Contacts Components**
   - PositionDialog.tsx - A dialog component for positions that isn't imported

3. **Stores**
   - userStore.ts - A store that isn't being used in the application

4. **Next.js Components**
   - _app.tsx - A Next.js app file that isn't needed in this Vite-based React application

5. **Layout Components**
   - Layout.tsx - A layout component that isn't used

6. **Backup Files**
   - CustomersPage.backup.tsx - A backup file that is no longer needed

## Restoration

If any of these files are needed in the future, they can be restored from this backup directory. The files maintain their original directory structure for easy restoration.

## Notes

After analyzing the codebase and imports, we determined that:

1. None of these components and stores are imported or used in the main application
2. Some were likely part of an earlier version of the application
3. Others appear to be remnants of features that were developed but never fully integrated

Removing these files should further reduce the number of TypeScript errors without affecting the application's functionality.
