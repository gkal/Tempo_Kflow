# Extra Unused Files Backup

This directory contains additional files that were removed from the codebase as they appear to be unused or unnecessary.

## Categories of Removed Files

1. **Example/Demo Files**
   - SendFormLinkButtonExample.tsx - Appears to be used only for documentation/demonstration

2. **Workers Not Imported Anywhere**
   - databaseStatisticsCollector.ts - A worker that monitors database statistics but isn't used
   - index.ts - Workers module entry point that isn't imported

3. **Types Files with Errors**
   - databaseExtensions.ts - Type definitions that caused TypeScript errors

4. **Documentation/Refactoring Files**
   - refactoring-summary-customerform.md
   - refactoring-summary-final.md
   - refactoring-summary.md
   - refactoring-plan-customerform.md
   - refactoring-plan.md

## Restoration

If any of these files are needed in the future, they can be restored from this backup directory. The files maintain their original directory structure for easy restoration.

## Notes

After analyzing the codebase, we determined that:

1. The example components are not used in production code
2. The workers aren't imported by any part of the application
3. The refactoring documentation files are not needed for the application to function
4. The types file with errors wasn't being properly used

Removing these files should help clean up the codebase further and reduce TypeScript errors without affecting application functionality.
