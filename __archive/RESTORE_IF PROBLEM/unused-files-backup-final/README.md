# Final Unused Files Backup

This directory contains the final set of files that were removed from the codebase as part of the cleanup process. These files represent entire feature sets that aren't being used in the main application.

## Categories of Removed Files

1. **GDPR Components**
   - ConsentCheckbox.tsx
   - ConsentRequired.tsx
   - DataSubjectRequestForm.tsx
   - PrivacyPolicy.tsx
   - index.ts

   These components were likely developed for GDPR compliance features but aren't currently being used in the application. They may represent a feature that was planned but not fully implemented.

2. **Security Services**
   - encryptionService.ts
   - fieldEncryptionService.ts
   - transportSecurityService.ts

   These security services implement encryption functionality but aren't being imported or used anywhere in the main application. They appear to be unused utilities.

## Restoration

If any of these files are needed in the future, they can be restored from this backup directory. The files maintain their original directory structure for easy restoration.

## Notes

After checking the main application codebase, we determined that:

1. None of the GDPR components are being imported or used in the main application flow
2. The security services are only referenced by other security services, not by the application itself

Removing these files should significantly reduce the TypeScript errors in the codebase without affecting the application functionality.
