# Additional Unused Files Backup

This directory contains additional files that were removed from the main codebase due to them causing errors and not being actively used in the application. These files include:

## Categories of Removed Files

1. **Security Components and Services**
   - Security scanning dashboard
   - IP restriction service
   - JWT service
   - Multi-factor authentication service

2. **Form Approval Related Components**
   - Form approval queue
   - Form approval detail
   - Form approval page

3. **Unused Hooks**
   - Form error tracking hook
   - Performance monitoring hook

4. **Backup and Test Files**
   - CustomersPage.backup.tsx

5. **Other Utilities**
   - Rate limiting utility

## Restoration

If you need any of these files, they maintain their original directory structure within this backup folder. You can copy them back to their original locations in the src directory.

## Note

These files appear to be part of features that were either:
1. In development but not fully integrated
2. Replaced by newer implementations
3. No longer needed in the current application flow

After confirming that the application works correctly without these files, you may safely delete this backup directory.
