# Fast-Grid Integration Plan

## Phase 1: Setup & Preparation (1-2 days)

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Install Fast-Grid package:
     ```bash
     npm install fast-grid
     ```
   - Setup TypeScript configuration for Fast-Grid
   - Create `types/fast-grid.d.ts` if needed for better TypeScript support

2. **Create Proof of Concept**
   - Create a simple test implementation with a small dataset
   - Verify basic Fast-Grid functionality works with your application
   - Test multi-threading capabilities
   - Benchmark initial performance

3. **API Integration Planning**
   - Map existing Supabase queries to pagination-friendly format
   - Design server-side filtering/sorting strategy
   - Identify necessary backend changes for efficient data retrieval

## Phase 2: Core Implementation (3-4 days)

1. **Create FastGridCustomers Component**
   - Implement Fast-Grid initialization
   - Configure column definitions
   - Setup grid container with proper styling

2. **Implement Server-Side Pagination**
   - Modify Supabase queries to use `.range()` for pagination
   - Create a separate count query for total records
   - Implement page navigation controls
   - Add preloading of next page for smooth experience

3. **Implement Data Processing**
   - Setup data transformation from API response to grid format
   - Configure shared array buffer for multi-threaded processing
   - Implement efficient data updates when filtering/sorting

4. **Separate Data Concerns**
   - Implement lazy loading for offer counts
   - Create batch operations for fetching related data
   - Optimize memory usage with strategic data loading

## Phase 3: Advanced Features & UI (2-3 days)

1. **Cell Rendering & Customization**
   - Implement custom cell renderers for special columns (status, actions)
   - Match existing UI styles and visual identity
   - Add hover effects and selection highlighting

2. **Filtering & Sorting**
   - Implement client-side filtering for quick filtering
   - Add debounced server-side filtering for complex filtering
   - Setup multi-column sorting
   - Preserve filter/sort state during pagination

3. **Expanded Row / Detail View**
   - Implement expandable rows for customer details
   - Add lazy loading of offers within expanded view
   - Optimize expanded view rendering

4. **Event Handling**
   - Implement row click navigation
   - Add context menu support
   - Setup keyboard navigation
   - Configure selection model

## Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (2-3 days)

1. **Performance Testing**
   - Test with progressively larger datasets (1K, 5K, 10K, 50K)
   - Measure and optimize memory usage
   - Identify and fix rendering bottlenecks
   - Profile and optimize JavaScript execution

2. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Test across modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Implement fallbacks for browsers without SharedArrayBuffer support
   - Ensure consistent rendering across platforms

3. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
   - Verify screen reader compatibility
   - Add necessary ARIA attributes
   - Test high contrast mode

4. **Final Optimizations**
   - Reduce bundle size with code splitting
   - Implement caching strategies for repeated queries
   - Fine-tune virtualization parameters
   - Add performance monitoring

## Phase 5: Integration & Deployment (2 days)

1. **Replace Existing Implementation**
   - Integrate Fast-Grid component into CustomerPage
   - Ensure all existing features are preserved
   - Match existing filtering/sorting behavior
   - Preserve navigation patterns

2. **Final Testing**
   - Perform regression testing against current implementation
   - Verify all features work as expected
   - Benchmark performance improvements
   - Test with real production data volumes

3. **Documentation**
   - Document the implementation architecture
   - Create usage guidelines for future developers
   - Document any API changes
   - Create performance monitoring guidelines

4. **Deployment**
   - Create deployment plan with rollback strategy
   - Consider gradual rollout or feature flag
   - Monitor performance metrics after deployment
   - Gather user feedback

## Total Estimated Timeline: 10-14 days

This timeline assumes a single developer focusing exclusively on this integration. The timeline could be compressed with multiple developers or extended if other work needs to be handled simultaneously.

## Success Criteria

The integration will be considered successful when:

1. Fast-Grid implementation can handle 10,000+ customers without performance degradation
2. UI maintains 60fps+ scrolling performance even with filtering applied
3. Memory usage stays below 300MB even with large datasets
4. All existing functionality is preserved
5. Load time is under 1 second for initial data display
