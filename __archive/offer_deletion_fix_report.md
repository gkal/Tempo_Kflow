# Offer Deletion Fix Report

## Issues Identified

1. **Hard deletion instead of soft deletion**: The application was attempting to perform hard deletion of offers by using the Supabase `delete()` method, but the system is designed to use soft deletion where records are marked as deleted but not immediately removed from the database.

2. **Missing cascade for offer_details**: When an offer is deleted, the associated offer_details records should also be deleted. While there is a foreign key with `ON DELETE CASCADE` in the database, this only works for hard deletes, not soft deletes.

3. **Inconsistent deletion handling**: Different components were handling offer deletion differently, causing potential inconsistencies.

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Updated deletion functions in all components**:
   - Modified `handleDeleteConfirm` in `CustomerOffersPage.tsx` to use `soft_delete_record` RPC function
   - Added fallback to regular delete in case the soft delete function is not available
   - Also updated the same function in `OffersPage.tsx` and `ImprovedOffersPage.tsx`
   - Updated `deleteOfferDetail` in `offerDetailsService.ts` to use soft delete with fallback

2. **Added soft delete migration script**:
   - Created SQL script in `supabase/migrations/soft_delete/add_soft_delete_to_offers.sql`
   - This script adds the `deleted_at` column to the offers and offer_details tables
   - Implements several utility functions for soft delete operations
   - Sets up a trigger to automatically soft-delete offer_details when the parent offer is soft-deleted

3. **Updated fetch functions to filter out deleted records**:
   - Modified `fetchCustomerOffers`, `fetchAllOffers`, and `fetchCustomers` in `CustomerOffersPage.tsx`
   - Added `.is("deleted_at", null)` filter to all queries to ensure soft-deleted records are excluded

4. **Added documentation**:
   - Created `supabase/migrations/soft_delete/README.md` with instructions for implementing soft delete throughout the application
   - Included examples and patterns for updating all queries

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Update all other queries**:
   - All queries throughout the application that fetch offers or offer_details should be updated to include the `.is("deleted_at", null)` filter

2. **Add UI for recovering deleted items**:
   - The `RecoveryPage.tsx` component should include the ability to restore soft-deleted offers and offer_details

3. **Schedule cleanup job**:
   - Set up a scheduled job to run the `cleanup_all_soft_deleted_records` function periodically (e.g., daily) to permanently remove records that have been soft-deleted for more than 30 days

4. **Testing**:
   - Thoroughly test the deletion and recovery process to ensure it works as expected
   - Verify that when an offer is deleted, its offer_details are also properly marked as deleted
   - Confirm that deleted offers do not appear in any listing pages

## Conclusion

The implemented changes fix the issue where offers were reported as successfully deleted but remained in the database. By properly implementing soft delete functionality and ensuring all related records are handled consistently, the system now provides a more robust and user-friendly experience for managing offers.
