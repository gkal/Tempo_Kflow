# Project Planning Document

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Principles

### üîí Data Management
- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS USE SOFT DELETE**
  - Never use hard delete operations in the database
  - All tables must support soft delete with `is_deleted` and `deleted_at` columns
  - Use `softDeleteRecord` function from supabaseService for all deletions
  - Filter out soft-deleted records in queries unless explicitly needed
  - Reason: Preserves data history, allows recovery, maintains referential integrity, and enables audit trails

### üåê Central Database Operations
- **All database operations MUST use these central functions from supabaseService:**
  1. `createRecord<T>`: Create new records
  2. `updateRecord<T>`: Update existing records
  3. `softDeleteRecord<T>`: Soft delete records (NEVER use hard delete)
  4. `fetchRecords<T>`: Get records with filtering and pagination
  5. `fetchRecordById<T>`: Get single record by ID
  - These functions handle:
    - Type safety
    - Error handling
    - Audit trails
    - Consistent behavior
    - Proper database interactions
  - Direct Supabase client usage is prohibited

### üéØ Project Goals
- Build a modern, efficient, and user-friendly offer management system
- Ensure data integrity and traceability
- Maintain clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Focus on performance and scalability

### üé® Style Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow modern React patterns and best practices
- Implement responsive design principles
- Ensure accessibility compliance

### üîÑ Error Handling & Notifications
- **DO NOT USE TOAST MESSAGES**
  - Avoid floating/transient notifications for errors
  - Display errors inline near the action buttons where possible
  - If space is limited, temporarily increase form height to display errors above buttons
  - Error messages should be clear and actionable
  - Keep error messages visible until explicitly dismissed or issue is resolved
  - Reason: Provides better visibility, clear association with the error source, and prevents missed notifications

### üîÑ UI Components & Standards
- **Delete Confirmations**
  - Always use `ModernDeleteConfirmation` component
  - Never create custom delete dialogs
  - Component handles:
    - UUID formatting (shows "œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒµœÄŒπŒªŒµŒ≥ŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑ ŒµŒ≥Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒÆ" instead)
    - Consistent styling
    - Loading states
    - Success/Error feedback
    - Proper Greek translations
  - Access via:
    1. Direct component: `<ModernDeleteConfirmation />`
    2. Hook: `useDeleteConfirmation()`
    3. Wrapper: `<DeleteConfirmationDialog />`

- **Global Utility Components**
  - Use these standardized components for consistent UI/UX:
  
  1. **GlobalTooltip**
     - Purpose: Display tooltips on hover with configurable options
     - Features:
       - Customizable width, position, and delay
       - Text truncation with automatic tooltips
       - Overflow protection for long content
       - Consistent styling across application
     - Components:
       - `<GlobalTooltip />`: Core tooltip component
       - `<TruncateWithTooltip />`: Auto-truncates text and shows tooltip
     - Usage: Ideal for displaying additional info or full text of truncated elements
  
  2. **GlobalDropdown**
     - Purpose: Standardized dropdown for selectable options
     - Features:
       - Consistent styling and behavior
       - Custom rendering of options and values
       - Support for objects or string options
       - Optional edit button
     - Usage: For all dropdowns/select inputs throughout the application
  
  3. **DialogUtilities**
     - Purpose: Standardized dialogs for consistent user interaction
     - Components:
       - `<ModernDeleteConfirmation />`: For delete confirmations
       - `<DialogWrapper />`: Basic dialog wrapper
       - `<AccessibleDialog />`: Accessibility-focused dialog
     - Usage: Maintain consistent dialog behavior across the application

## üîÑ Recent Refactoring Work

### üö® Phone-Only Match Detection and Warning System
- **Date:** 2025-04-04
- **Components:**
  - duplicateDetectionService.ts in src/services/
  - CustomerForm.tsx in src/components/customers/

#### Changes Implemented:
1. **Dedicated Phone-Only Search Function:**
   - Created new `findDuplicatesByPhoneOnly` function to identify cases where different companies share the same phone number
   - Implemented distinct scoring system that flags matches as phone-only matches
   - Added a threshold filter (90% by default) to ensure only high-quality phone matches are shown

2. **Enhanced UI Warning System:**
   - Added a dedicated red-bordered warning section for phone-only matches
   - Implemented clear visual differentiation between regular matches and phone-only matches
   - Added warning icon and explanatory text to alert users to potential issues
   - Special styling indicates the high importance of reviewing these matches

3. **Use Cases Addressed:**
   - Multiple business entities sharing same phone number
   - Data entry errors with incorrect company names
   - Phone numbers that have been reassigned to new companies
   - Potential duplicate customer records

4. **Technical Implementation:**
   - Separate database query focused exclusively on phone matching
   - Independent threshold and scoring system from the main duplicate detection
   - Custom typing to ensure type safety and correct property access
   - Efficient filtering and sorting to prioritize strongest matches

#### Benefits:
- Provides dedicated visibility for an important edge case (same phone, different name)
- Creates clear separation between general similarity matches and phone-only matches
- Reduces potential for missed duplicates due to combined scoring algorithms
- Improves data quality by highlighting potential data entry errors
- Enhances user experience by separately flagging different types of potential issues

### üì± Phone Number Normalization and Search Enhancement
- **Date:** 2025-04-03
- **Components:**
  - duplicateDetectionService.ts in src/services/
  - Database query functions in src/lib/supabaseClient.ts

#### Changes Implemented:
1. **Improved Phone Number Normalization:**
   - Implemented SQL function to extract and normalize the first 10 digits of phone numbers
   - Created consistent normalization approach to handle various phone formats (with dashes, dots, spaces, and special characters)
   - Added support for phone numbers with extensions and annotations
   - SQL implementation handles the normalization at the database level for faster searches

2. **SQL Function for Phone Normalization:**
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION normalize_phone(phone_text TEXT) 
   RETURNS TEXT AS $$
   BEGIN
     RETURN SUBSTRING(REGEXP_REPLACE(phone_text, '[^0-9]', '', 'g'), 1, 10);
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
   ```

3. **Enhanced Search Implementation:**
   - Modified queries to use the normalize_phone function:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM customers 
   WHERE normalize_phone(telephone) = normalize_phone(:search_telephone);
   ```
   - Integrated with existing fuzzy matching for better accuracy
   - Maintained backward compatibility with current search patterns

4. **Benefits:**
   - Handles unpredictable user input patterns (special characters, annotations, etc.)
   - Focuses on the core phone number (first 10 digits) while ignoring extensions and notes
   - Provides consistent matching regardless of phone number formatting
   - Accommodates real-world use cases where users add symbols for their own reference

#### Implementation Rationale:
- Phone numbers are stored in varying formats (dashes, dots, spaces, symbols)
- Users often add special characters or notes (e.g., * for "good customer")
- Normalizing to the first 10 digits provides the best balance between:
  - Capturing the essential identifying information 
  - Ignoring irrelevant formatting and annotations
  - Consistent matching across different input patterns

#### Next Steps:
- Monitor performance and accuracy of the phone number matching
- Consider adding a dedicated normalized_telephone column for further optimization
- Extend the approach to other numeric identifiers if needed

### üîç Customer Duplicate Detection Enhancement v1.5.4

#### Changes Implemented:
1. **Improved Duplicate Detection Algorithm:**
   - Implemented fuzzball.js for fuzzy string matching with token_sort_ratio
   - Enhanced phone matching with prefix detection and normalized comparison
   - Added weighted scoring system with configurable weights (40% company name, 40% phone, 20% AFM)
   - Created special handling for exact AFM and phone matches
   - Added Greek character normalization to handle accented characters (œÑœåŒΩŒøœÖœÇ)

2. **UI Enhancements:**
   - Integrated duplicate detection into the "Surprise" section of the customer form
   - Redesigned duplicate match display with color-coding based on match confidence
   - Added detailed customer information dialog when clicking on matches

   - Fixed capitalization for Greek headers (removed œÑœåŒΩŒøœÖœÇ in all-caps text)

3. **Data Presentation:**
   - Added counts for offers and contacts in customer detail view
   - Implemented status indicators with appropriate icons
   - Enhanced audit information display (created/modified/deleted by whom and when)
   - Added proper user-friendly display of dates and times

4. **Technical Improvements:**
   - Fixed database query issues to avoid foreign key errors
   - Implemented proper text normalization for Greek characters
   - Enhanced telephone number standardization to handle various formats
   - Created robust similarity calculation logic that properly combines scores

#### Benefits:
