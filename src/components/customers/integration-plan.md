# Fast-Grid Integration Plan
## Step-by-Step Implementation Timeline

## Phase 1: Setup & Preparation (1-2 Days)

### Day 1: Environment Setup
- [x] Install Fast-Grid package: `npm install fast-grid`
- [ ] Install TypeScript definitions: `npm install --save-dev @types/fast-grid`
- [ ] Update tsconfig.json to support Fast-Grid (if needed)
- [ ] Create proof-of-concept file structure:
  - `src/components/customers/fast-grid-poc.tsx`
  - `src/components/customers/fast-grid-implementation-guide.md`

### Day 2: Proof of Concept
- [ ] Create a basic Fast-Grid implementation
- [ ] Setup minimal styling to match current UI
- [ ] Implement basic data fetching with pagination
- [ ] Test with small dataset to verify functionality

## Phase 2: Core Implementation (3-4 Days)

### Day 3-4: Data Management
- [ ] Implement server-side pagination
- [ ] Create optimized data loading functions
- [ ] Implement filtering mechanisms
- [ ] Create batch data processing for offers count
- [ ] Add error handling and loading states
- [ ] Optimize query performance

### Day 5-6: UI Integration
- [ ] Match styling with current design system
- [ ] Implement all column configurations
- [ ] Add custom cell renderers for special columns
- [ ] Configure event handlers for row/cell interactions
- [ ] Add support for column sorting
- [ ] Implement responsive design adjustments

## Phase 3: Advanced Features & UI (2-3 Days)

### Day 7-8: Enhanced Functionality
- [ ] Implement customer status toggling
- [ ] Add customer deletion handling
- [ ] Setup context menu functionality
- [ ] Add customer type filtering
- [ ] Implement optimized search functionality
- [ ] Add debounced search input handling

### Day 9: UI Polish
- [ ] Refine animations and transitions
- [ ] Enhance loading indicators
- [ ] Add empty state handling
- [ ] Improve accessibility features
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation support
- [ ] Implement focus management

## Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (2 Days)

### Day 10: Performance Testing
- [ ] Test with 1,000 records
- [ ] Test with 10,000 records
- [ ] Test with 100,000 records (simulated if needed)
- [ ] Measure memory usage
- [ ] Measure render times
- [ ] Check FPS during scrolling
- [ ] Optimize bottlenecks

### Day 11: Cross-Browser Testing
- [ ] Test in Chrome
- [ ] Test in Firefox
- [ ] Test in Safari
- [ ] Test in Edge
- [ ] Fix any browser-specific issues
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes
- [ ] Optimize for mobile view

## Phase 5: Integration & Deployment (2-3 Days)

### Day 12-13: Final Integration
- [ ] Create route for new Fast-Grid view
- [ ] Add navigation between views
- [ ] Refine A/B testing capability
- [ ] Prepare for gradual rollout
- [ ] Document all implementation details
- [ ] Create user guide for team members

### Day 14: Deployment
- [ ] Final code review
- [ ] Prepare deployment package
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Conduct final tests
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor performance and usage

## Total Estimated Timeline: 10-14 Days

## Success Criteria
- Grid renders 100,000+ records with no performance degradation
- Memory usage stays below 250MB even with large datasets
- UI maintains 60+ FPS during all operations
- All existing functionality is preserved
- Visual design matches current system
- Search and filtering operations complete in under 100ms

## Risk Mitigation
- Implement feature flags for easy rollback
- Start with A/B testing approach
- Maintain both implementations during transition
- Gather user feedback before full rollout
- Monitor performance metrics in production
