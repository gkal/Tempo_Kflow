# UI Components Cleanup Summary

## Documentation Consolidation

### Consolidated Documentation

- **Tooltips**: Combined `README-TOOLTIP.md` and `README-TOOLTIPS.md` into a single comprehensive `README-TOOLTIP.md` document
- **Forms**: Merged `forms.md` and `README-FORMS.md` into a single `README-FORMS.md` document
- **Tabs**: Combined `README-TABS.md` and `README-APP-TABS.md` into a single `README-APP-TABS.md` document
- **Main README**: Updated the main `README.md` to provide an overview of all UI components and reference specialized documentation

### Removed Duplicate Files

- Deleted `README-TOOLTIPS.md` (merged into `README-TOOLTIP.md`)
- Deleted `forms.md` (merged into `README-FORMS.md`)
- Deleted `README-TABS.md` (merged into `README-APP-TABS.md`)

## Identified Component Deprecations

The following components have been identified as deprecated and are marked for replacement:

### Tooltip Components
- `tooltip.tsx` - Replaced by `GlobalTooltip.tsx`
- `truncated-text.tsx` - Replaced by `TruncateWithTooltip` in `GlobalTooltip.tsx`

### Tabs Components

- `custom-tabs.tsx` (SimpleTabs, CustomTabs) - Replaced by components in `app-tabs.tsx`

## Documentation Improvements

- Added migration guides for deprecated components
- Improved component usage examples
- Added best practices sections
- Organized documentation into clear sections
- Added code conventions and standards
- Improved accessibility documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Component Migration**:
   - Help teams migrate from deprecated tooltip components to `GlobalTooltip`
   - Complete migration from legacy tabs to `AppTabs`

2. **Code Cleanup**:
   - Once all usages are migrated, remove deprecated components
   - Update imports throughout the codebase

3. **Component Consolidation**:
   - Consider consolidating similar dialog components
   - Evaluate potential duplicate form components

4. **Documentation Maintenance**:
   - Keep documentation updated as components evolve
   - Ensure examples remain current

All these changes were made without modifying the UI functionality, as requested.
