# CustomersPage Refactoring Plan

## Goal
Break down the large CustomersPage.tsx file (1300+ lines) into smaller, more manageable components without changing UI functionality.

## Completed Extractions
1. ✅ `OfferTableRow.tsx` - Extracted component for offer table rows
2. ✅ `CustomerOffersSection.tsx` - Extracted component for offers section
3. ✅ `CustomerTableColumns.tsx` - Extracted table column configurations
4. ✅ `utils/formatters.ts` - Extracted formatting functions
5. ✅ `utils/customerRealtimeHandlers.ts` - Extracted real-time handlers
6. ✅ `CustomerExpandedContent.tsx` - Extracted expanded row content 

## Next Steps

### 1. Create CustomerActionsHandler.tsx
- Extract dialog handling logic (delete offer, delete customer)
- Includes ModernDeleteConfirmation dialog setup

### 2. Create CustomerDataProvider component
- Handle data fetching logic
- Real-time subscriptions 
- Data filtering

### 3. Update CustomersPage.tsx
- Import all extracted components
- Replace inline functions with imported ones
- Simplify component structure
- Keep UI visually identical

### 4. Integration testing
- Verify that all functionality works correctly
- Ensure UI remains unchanged
- Test real-time updates

### Benefits of Refactoring
- Improved maintainability
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier code navigation
- Smaller, focused components

### Important Considerations
- Preserve all existing UI details
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Keep the same styling and behavior
- Don't introduce any new dependencies
